# JobSearch

---------------
Warning: this project is no longer functional. Monster and Indeed have changed their websites and the webscrapers no longer work.
Also, some of the front end functionality such as the favorites section was never fully complete.
---------------

Aggregates job listing from Indeed and Monster.com based on key search terms, location, and distance from location. Uses a react front end and then python web scrapers for aggregating the job listings.

To run the project for the first time (instructions are for windows):

In a terminal navigate to the "back" folder, run "npm install", then "npm start". 
In a seperate terminal, navigate to the "front\job-search" folder, run "npm install", then "npm start".
Open localhost::3000 in a browser.

To run the project after the first time, do the same steps but omit the two "npm install" commands.
